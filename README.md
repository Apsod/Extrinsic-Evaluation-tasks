# Extrinsic-Evaluation-tasks
A suite of tasks for extrinsic evaluation of word embedding models.

Forked from https://github.com/shashwath94/Extrinsic-Evaluation-tasks.

Refactored into a command-line interface that takes a path to an embedding and runs the tests on it. 
The sequence labeling has also been made part of the repo.
